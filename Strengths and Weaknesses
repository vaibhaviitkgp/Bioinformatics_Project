Discuss strengths and weaknesses of  Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Tree,  KNN  for predicting Heart Disease.

Logistic Regression: 

Strengths:
1. Easy to implement 
2. Nice performance on linear data
3. Outputs better probabilities
Weaknesses: 
1. Fails to capture complex relationships
2. Only for linear boundaries
3. Overfits on high dimensional data

Support Vector Machine:

Strengths:
1. Robust to outliers
2. Effective in high dimensional spaces
3. Relatively memory efficient
Weaknesses 
1. Not suitable for large datasets
2. Low performance when target classes overlap
3. No probabilistic explanation for the classification


Decision Tree:

Strengths:
1. Does not require normalization and scaling of data
2. Less efforts during data pre-processing
3. Very intuitive model and easy to interpret
Weaknesses 
1. Complex calculations than other models
2. Higher time to train the model
3. Changes in data can cause instability of tree

KNN:

Strengths:
1. No training required
2. Handles large data sets
3. Non-parametric architecture
Weaknesses:
1. Sensitive to the choice of K
2. Computationally expensive 
3. Memory intensive
